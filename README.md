# part-02  Summary



All difficult things will become easier than you think but trust your mind and go with confidence and determination


## the key points that every developer must master :*

 ### 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software
 * Think about your goal before you start 
 * > "the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are."
   _Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity_


 ### 2. The Goals of Software Design
 * The design and the front end are important for the longevity of the business
 * > "To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as helpful as possible."      
 _Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity_
 *  there are two key points here: Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others


 ### 3. (Mis)understanding
* Always think _(why am I doing this?)  
* > "Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer."  _Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity_



 ### 4. Simplicity
* > "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." _— _Leonardo da Vinci_
* That your work and what you offer be clear so that everyone can understand it, the less complicated you make things, the more you give a picture of how well you are.
**Don't count on an expert being a philosopher**


 ### 5. Complexity
* > "Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming."   _Brian Kernighan_
* To avoid complexity
   * you will exactly know your software purpose and its definition.
   *  you will be as simple as possible in every piece of code you write.
   * when a new feature or change request comes to the discussion table, you will evaluate them based on your software purpose and question them.
* As a developer resistance to (unnecessary) change   



 ### 6. Maintenance
* It is not right to create your business and forget it, following it is necessary for maintenance and improvement
* When creating a business, consider maintenance
* > "It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation."
_Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity_


 ### 7. Consistency
* > "Consistency is a big part of simplicity. If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place. For example, if you name a variable thisIsVariable, then all of your variables should be named that way (otherVariable, anAnotherVariable, etc. not other_variable)." _Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity_


 ### 8. Prioritizing
* The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.
* Ask your self :
    * The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
    *  The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
    * The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?

* > "The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change." _Code Simplicity_



 ### 9. Solving Problems
* to Solving Problems you need to do this steps:
   * understanding becouse 
   > f you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.   _Richard Feynman_
     * planning 
     > "Think before acting
     *  dividing
     >Don’t try to solve one big problem
      

 ### 10. Good enough is fine
* Don't be overly detailed...just think about what software needs to be done to get better
* >"Perfect is the enemy of good."   _Voltaire_


 ### 11. Predictions
> "A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future. It could be factual and based on some kind of objective data or it could be based on an assumption."


 ### 12. Assumptions
* An **assumption** is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof


 ### 13. Stop Reinventing
* Use your methods, resources and ideas, don't waste your time


 ### 14. Resistance
* Remember what the purpose of your program is and if it needs **small changes** make them


 ### 15. Automation
* Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks


 ### 16. Code measurement
* > "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight."
 _Bill Gates_


 ### 17. Productivity
* We must get rid of the surplus in all its forms and from all its places so that all things remain comfortable


 ### 18. Testing
  * Don't be in a hurry, think, meditate, and try


 ### 19. (Under)Estimation
* Remember to give time for everything you do too much, you may miss out on a lot and have to make up for it


 ### 20. Running Away From Rewriting
* Reading the code is difficult and heavy, but refactoring and understanding what happened would be a better and wiser option


 ### 21. Documentation and Commenting
* explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”.
* >"The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing. If you don’t explain this, other programmers may be confused and when they go to change your code they might remove important parts of it." _Code Simplicity_


 ### 22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)
* There are a few factors you should consider before you start using some technology:

   * Is there active development behind it?
  * Will it continue to be maintained?
  * How easy is it to switch away from?
  * What does the community say about it?


 ### 23. Self-Development
* Keep learning


 ### 24. Don’t be a hero
* Take your time and focus on the results, don't rush or else you will get frustrated and stop
* >"So you go into hero mode. You’re determined to make it work (and slightly embarrassed that it isn’t already working). You grab your cape and shut yourself off from the world." _Jason Fried_


 ### 25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
* Research increases your knowledge and experience and broadens your view of the field. Do not deprive yourself of a quick request for help and get the best solution.
